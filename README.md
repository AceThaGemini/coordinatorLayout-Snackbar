# coordinatorLayout-Snackbar
This demo explains about snackbar with few examples covering different scenarios.

In Material Design, Snackbars are just like Toast messages except they provide action to interact with. Snackbar will be displayed at the bottom of the screen and can be swiped off in order to dismiss them.

I've tried to cover as many scenarios as I could to demonstrates different appearances and behaviors of Snackbars depending on situations while a user interact with the app.
